This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `large-scale-data-analysis.ipynb`. The notebook demonstrates problem-solving skills using Python, showcasing a step-by-step approach to tackling the challenge.

## Features

### Download or Generate Airline Performance Data

**Objective:**  
Analyze flight delay patterns using a large aviation dataset.

**Instructions:**
- Download a single yearâ€™s data (e.g., `2008.csv.bz2`) from Kaggle: [Airline On-Time Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays).
- **Alternative:** Use the dummy data generator script if download is not possible.
